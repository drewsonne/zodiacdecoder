The client is implemented with the feature of sending keys above a constant threshold score value to a dedicated server. The server stores the keys in a database and keeps track of the number of keys sent to it. The keys may then be checked by a human reader to verify correctness in the cipher. The human reader may also see that if the solution is almost correct except for one symbol in the cipher, it is a near-correct solution. The edited or unedited key may be sent back to the server as a solution that is worth looking at. These keys are stored in a separate database which may be looked over at a later date.
