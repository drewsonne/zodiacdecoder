	In considering the linguistic properties of the 340-cipher, we took a thorough analysis of both the it and the original, three part 408-cipher. In the 340-cipher, there are 63 unique characters used in the cipher, most of them latin characters, latin characters mirrored, and shapes, such as a circle with a cross (which the Zodiac used as his signature), and circles, square, and triangles with different designs in them. In order to be process the individual characters, each symbol was given a two digit number that corresponded to its position in the cipher where it was first used. For example, the first character is 00, the second character 01, and so on. We performed a frequency analysis on the cipher using a custom program. [insert frequency chart] The results showed that we could not easily use a frequency analysis to break the cipher. Using a separate custom program, we analyzed the n-grams of cipher (where n=2,3,4,5). The results showed that the Zodiac was very good at keeping away from patterns. Very few digrams or trigrams were repeated in the cipher. We also used the program to analyze a large body of English text. The scoring algorithms uses these statistics the score the solutions. Finally, a separate program was developed in order to take the body of Zodiac letters and keep statistics of what words were used by the Zodiac, including misspellings, and use this in the dictionary for the client.
