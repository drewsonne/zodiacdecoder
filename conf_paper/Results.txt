As the tuning process for ZodiacDecoder is ongoing, the obvious desired result of a 100% certainly cracked cipher is still far from obtained.  As you examine our progress, though, I believe you will realize that our attempt has been one of the most sophisticated to date.  The most important result we have collected is that a genetically mutating algorithm is the strongest decrypting process we have utilized.  Our work now will deal mainly with fine tuning our scoring methods.  Without proper scoring, even the most fit algorithm is useless.  While we have come up with a multitude of ideas for the best way to score, we have concluded that a combination of bi-gram, tri-gram, and word frequencies is paramount.  We can expect there will be a few key "solving words" that will undoubtably aid the cipher cracking process.  These "words" come mainly from our massive collection of writings confirmed to be from the zodiac killer himself.  Being that our efforts include the killer's personal writings as a source lookup dictionary, we can expect to see some of these "solving words" to be the catalyst that will break the decrypting wide open (much in the way that "Ilikekilling" gave a foothold to the first solution).  On that note, there have been certain phrases appearing in our key->solution attempts, which is very encouraging - we can only expect to see more and more logical phrases appearing in the future.  Ultimately though, our results are not definative enough to rule out the looming thought that Zodiac made a "junk" cipher merely to infuriate a team of college students, some 30 years after his time.
