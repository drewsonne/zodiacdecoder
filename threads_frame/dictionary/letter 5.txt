This is the Zodiac speaking. I am the murderer of the taxi driver over by Washington St and Maple St last night , to prove this here is a blood stained piece of his shirt. I am the same man who did in the poople in the north bay area. The S.F. Police could have cought me last night if they had searched the park properly in stead of holding road races with their motorcicle seeing who could make the most noise. The cab drivers should have just parked their cars and sat there quietly waiting for me to come out of cover. School children make nice target, I think I shall wipe out a school bus some morning. Just shoot out the front tire and then pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out.
