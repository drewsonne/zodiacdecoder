Dear Editor
This is the Zodiac speaking.
In answer to your asking for
more details about the good
times I have had in Vallejo,
I shall be very ha[?]ppy to
supply even more material.
By the way, are the police
haveing a good time with the
code? If not, tell them to cheer
up; when they do crack it
they will have me.
On the 4th of July:
I did not open the car door, The
window was rolled down allready.
The boy was origionaly sitting in
the front seat when I began
fireing. When I fired the first
shot at his head, he leaped
backwords[?] at the same time
thus spoiling my aim. He end-
ed up on the back seat then
the floor in back th[?]o[?]shing out
very violently with his legs;
thats how I shot him in the
(end of page 1)
knee. I did not leave the cene
of the killing with squealling
tires & raceing engine as described
in the Vallejo paper.. I drove away
quite slowly so as not to draw
attention to my car.
The man who told the police
that my car wa[?]s brown wa[?]s a
negro about 40-45 rather shabbly
dressed. I was at this phone
booth haveing some fun with the
Vallejo cop when he was wa[?]lking
by. When I hung the phone up
the da[?]m X@ thing began to
ring & that drew his attention
to me & my car.
Last Christmass
In that epasode the police were
wondering as to how I coo[?]ld
shoot & hit my victo[?]ms in the
dark. They did not openly state
this, but implied this by saying
it was a well lit night & I could
see the silowets on the horizon.
Bullshit that area is su[?]ounded
(end page 2)
by high hills & trees. What I did
was tape a small pencel flash
light to the barrel of my gun.
If you notice, in the centa[?]r
of the beam of light if you aim
it at a wall or ce[?]lling you will
see a black or darck spot in
the center of the circle of
light aprox 3 to 6 in. across.
When taped to a gun barrel,
the bullet will strike exactly
in the center of the black
dot in the light. All I had to do
was spray them as if it was
a water hose; there was no
need to use the gun sights.
I was not ha[?]ppy to see that I
did not get front page cover-
age.
