zWordReader.cpp
version 1.0.0

by Tanner Oakes

---------------------

This will scan a hard coded file called "zodiac.txt" and count the
occurences of each word. It will create a temporary file called "filter.txt"
and a final file called "results.txt" . It is unsorted and I just use Excel to
sort the data. Further down, if you un-comment some code you can switch from
space-delimited to tab-delimited data, if you prefer.

Included already in the folder is a pre-made "zodiac.txt" file which I culled from the 
Google group letters, after removing some extraneous data. If you'd like you can create your
own "zodiac.txt" file. 

Included files:

	* readme.txt			- This file
	* zWordReader.cpp		- The source file tested with G++ on Mac OS 10.5
	* zodiac.txt			- A compilation of the Zodiac letters
	* results__sorted.txt	- The sorted results in a txt document, created using Excel
	* results__sorted.xls	- The original sorted results file
