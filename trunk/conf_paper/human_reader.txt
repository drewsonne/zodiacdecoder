[Assuming this is placed in the paper after key submission is mentioned]
We then use a separate program known as the "Human Reader" or "Super Client." Unlike the main program, only by those who are to review the keys use the Human Reader. It receives keys from the server and allows the user to view the words found in the current key or edit the current key if necessary. After reviewing the key, the Human Reader can send the key back to the server. Keys sent by the Human Reader are stored in a separate list of proposed "good keys." Keys that are sent to the Human Reader from the server are deleted, thus any key not resubmitted by the human reader is removed from the first list. The Human Reader can also receive keys from files in the case that the main client could not send keys to the server. This program is necessary as it allows people to actually see and edit the results of a key and determine if it creates a believable solution as opposed to a random string of words.
[There are other features, such as the cheap random key generator and user mode, but I felt none of them were worth mentioning]
