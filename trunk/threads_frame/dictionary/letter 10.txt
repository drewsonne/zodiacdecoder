If you dont want me to
have this blast you must
do two things. 1Tell every
one about the bus bomb with
all the details. 2 I would like
to see some nice Zodiac butons
wandering about town. Every
one else has these buttons like,
[Peace Sign], black power, melvin eats
bluber, etc. Well it would cheer
me up considerbly if I saw
a lot of people wearing my 
buton. Please no nasty ones
like melvin's
Thank you
