Dear Melvin

This is the Zodiac speaking I wish you a happy Christmass. The one thing I ask of you is 
this, please help me. I can not reach out for help because of this thing in me wont let me. I am finding it extreamly dif-icult to hold it in check I am afraid I will loose control again and take my nineth and posibly tenth victom. Please help me I am drownding. At the moment the children are
safe from the bomb because it is so massive to dig in and the triger mech requires much work to get it adjusted just right. But if I hold back too long from no nine I will loose complet all controol of my self ad set the bomb up. Please help me I can
not remain in control for much longer.
